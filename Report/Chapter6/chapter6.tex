This project has shown that it is indeed possible to extract and translate models from Modelica into ProMoVis. For future development, the challenge does not lie in any issues related to control theory or mathematical challenges, the theory needed for this already exists and "just" needs to be implemented. Instead, the challenge lies in making it convenient for the user to use the export tool, and make it as seamless as possible to transition from the Modelica environment to the ProMoVis environment.
