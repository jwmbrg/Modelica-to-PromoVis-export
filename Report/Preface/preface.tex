I worked on this project during the spring of 2012 starting out as a novice in the field of control theory and physical modeling with only the most fundamental knowledge in the subject. But having been in touch with Modelica in earlier courses, and found it to be a powerful tool that I would like to deepen my understanding of. It was not hard to accept when Wolfgang Birk proposed this project.\\\newline The source code to the tool is currently available at https://github.com/jwmbrg/Modelica-to-PromoVis-export, although I probably will move the actual export software to a separate repository, without the school related information, for continued development after this project has ended.\\\newline I would like to thank Wolfgang Birk and Miguel Casta{\~{n}}o for the time and effort they have put down,  with their pragmatic approach, they have been invaluable in giving me a deepened understanding of the field of control theory and mathematical modeling.\\\newline Finally, I would like to give credit to Johan Carlson for providing the \LaTeX{} template used in formatting this report. \\\newline Hopefully the output of the project, the export tool, might help make ProMoVis more accessible to existing users of Modelica and also provide a foundation for a tighter integration between the two environments.\\\newline
