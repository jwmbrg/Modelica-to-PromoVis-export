I worked on this project during the spring of 2012 starting out as pretty inexperienced in the field of control theory with only the most fundamental knowledge in the subject. But having been in touch with Modelica, in earlier courses, and found it to be a powerful tool that i would like to deepen my understanding of. It was not hard to accept when Wolfgang proposed this project to me.\\\newline I would like to thank Wolfgang Birk and Miguel Casta{\~{n}}o for the time and effort they have put down,  with their pragmatic approach, they have been invaluable in giving me a deepened understanding of the field of control theory and mathematical modeling.\\\newline Hopefully the output of the project, the export tool, might help make ProMoVis more accessible to existing users of Modelica and also provide a foundation for a tighter integration between the two environments.\\\newline Finally, i would like to give credit to Johan Carlson for providing the \LaTeX{} template upon which this report is based. \\\newline
