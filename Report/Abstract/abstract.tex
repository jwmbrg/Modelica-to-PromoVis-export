ProMoVis provides an environment where engineers may, through a combination of visualisation and powerful analysis tools, analyse and deepen their understanding of processes with complex relations between its components. Currently a drawback is that the user has to create a model of the system, through the graphical interface that ProMoVis provides, even though he may have existing models, created in another environment. This report describes the development process and implementation of a tool, written in python, that utilizes the JModelica environment to export Models, described in Modelica, to the equivalent SFG representation used in ProMoVis. This is done through linearising the models around an operating point and then extracting a DAE representation of it. From the DAE, it is then possible to extract an SFG representation of how a variable depends on other variables in the system.
