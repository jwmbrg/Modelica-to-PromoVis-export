This document serves both as an example of the \LaTeX\ template
for Master's theses, and at the same time as documentation
on how to use it.

\section{Background}
Use a main document to set up title page and chapters. In this way
you can compile a subset of the entire thesis by simply commenting
the \texttt{$\backslash$input\{...\}} commands in the main document.
Typeset the document by compiling the main document. The
subdocuments can not be compiled by themselves.

\section{Problem Description}

\section{Project Goals}

\section{Including appendices}
At the end of the thesis, after all chapters but before the
reference list, you might want to add some appendices. To do this,
simply type \texttt{$\backslash$appendix} before the
\texttt{$\backslash$thebibliography} command and then add each
appendix with the \texttt{$\backslash$makeappendix} command
(identical syntax as the \texttt{$\backslash$makechapter}
command). See Appendix \ref{appA} for a completely meaningless
mathematical derivation.

\section{Including bibliography references}
At the end of the document you will have the list of bibliography
references. In this thesis the \textsc{BibTeX} reference system is
used. Add your references to a database file and the reference
list will be generated automatically. For more details on how to
use the \textsc{BibTeX} system, please refer to any good \LaTeX\
documentation, e.g.\ \cite{Lamport} or \cite{Goossens}.\nocite{*}
